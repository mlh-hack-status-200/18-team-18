It's a fact of life: people checking into the hospital face risks. Expecting to get better,
some actually wind up getting worse.
So, basically what our work is to ease some steps of the patient registration as this process takes too time and patient is not in that state to perform those task then in that case a patient need to submit only soft copy of his insurance in .pdf format. 
Rest based on study performed by our machine online confirmation of patient insurance is received if he/she is a valid user only .
Based on the above results the further process can be executed by the hospital 
By using our machine we are able to protect patient 2-3 day work which he/she had to do prior of the diagnosis to avail the concession over the bills .

here the automation is distributed into four parts:-
	A. pdf automation
         fetch the data required for patient from the uploaded insurance document pdf. 
	b. excel automation
         an excel sheet is automaticaly created of details of each and every patient.
	c. e-mail automation
         to varify the document an automatic mail is genetrated for the insurance company in order to get confirmation of the patient insurance .
	d. data automation
         based on the response received the patient is listed with the best doctors availble for his disease.
